Tossups:

1. One framework for this language contains the variable _SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR _YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED.
Variable declarations are moved to the top of the file in this language in the process of hoisting. It’s
not C# (“C-sharp”), but in this language, two question marks can check if a variable is undefined using
the nullish coalescing operator. The V8 engine powers this language’s most common runtime. Dynamic imports
were added to this language’s (*) ECMA2020 standard. To check for equality in this language without doing
an implicit type conversion, one would use 3 instead of 2 equal signs. In this language, one can call
the getElementById function to get elements from the DOM. This language’s namesake object notation is
known as JSON. For 10 points, name this language that is used alongside HTML and CSS in web development.

One of these products with a diving helmet-inspired design is named after the British Navy’s Royal Oak
series of ships. A Japanese company that makes these products pitted its Daini division against its Suwa
division, which makes the “Astron.” These devices may include additional “complications,” have (*) tourbillons
(“TOOR-bee-yawns”) in their escapements, and be powered by mainsprings. Types of these devices include
the “pilot” and “chronograph.” In the 1970s, Seiko’s production of these devices fueled a “quartz crisis”
