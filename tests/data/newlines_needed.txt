Tossups
1. To protect Bindusara from poison, Chanakya performed this action and subsequently placed Bindusara inside the stomachs of goats for seven days. This action was performed on a dying Clothru at Lough (“lock”) Ree, where her son Furbaide later avenged her by slinging cheese at Medb (“mayve”). After Coronis’s ill-fated affair with Ischys, Apollo performed this action at her funeral pyre, earning Aesclepius his name. To aid Rudaba, Zal burned a white (*) feather to summon the Simurgh and received its guidance on how to perform this action using wine. This action likely was not performed on Aurelia Cotta, as she survived to see her son invade Britain.

2. A duke of this ethnicity married a princess whom Anna Komnene described in battle as like “a second Athena,” named Sikelgaita. A ruler of this ethnicity commissioned the painted muqarnas ceilings of the Cappella Palatina, as well as an atlas whose 70 maps are oriented south-up. Duke Guaimario IV relied on the military services of brothers of this ethnicity from Hauteville, one of whom was nicknamed “the Terror.” The geographer al-Idrisi was commissioned to create the (*) Tabula Rogeriana by a king of this ethnicity who ruled Sicily. In return for ending the 911 CE Siege of Chartres (“SHART-ruh”), Charles the Simple granted a duchy to an ancestor of these people, the Viking Rollo. An artwork depicting an invasion by these people features Halley’s Comet and is housed at Bayeux Cathedral. For 10 points, name these people who invaded England under William the Conqueror.
